### Data Models

1. AllAuth User Model
    * Django Allauth, the User model is the default user model provided by the Django authentication system
    
---
2. Comment Model
    * Model made so that users can leave a comment on all posts
    * Comments can only be edited/ deleted by the original author
    * The User entity has a one-to-many relationship with the Comments entity. This means that a User can have multiple comments. But multiple comments cannot be made multiple users.
---
3. Post model
    * Model made so users can make posts on the forum.
    * the user entity has a one-to-many relationship with the post model. This means that one user can make multiple posts but multiple posts cannot have multiple users.
    * Only Admin can change the data in the backend.
    * input provided: title, content, topic, subtopic, experience_level, goal, equipment_available, workout frequency, nutrition focus

### Database Scheme

Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

![DataScheme](/staticfiles/readme_img/erd.png)

This data scheme allows for the management of users, posts, and comments. Users can make a post and each post can have multiple comments.
## Security Features

### User Authentication

* Django Allauth is a popular authentication and authorization library for Django, which provides a set of features for managing user authentication, registration, and account management.

### Login Decorator

* used on all CRUD views for posts and comments.

### CSRF Protection

* Django provides built-in protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. CSRF tokens are generated for each user session, and they are required to submit forms or perform state-changing actions. When a user logs out, the session and associated CSRF token are invalidated, making it difficult for an attacker to forge a valid request using a copied URL.


### Custom error pages

* 404 Error Page, provides user with a button the redirect to home page.
* 500 Error Page, provides user with a button the redirect to home page.

## Deployment and Local Developement

Live deployment can be found on this [View Sportpulse live website here](https://sportpulse-6bad7f07e667.herokuapp.com)

### Local Developement

#### How to Fork
1. Log in(or Sign Up) to Github
2. Go to repository for this project [Sportpulse](https://github.com/rasm1/SportPulse)
3. Click the fork button in the top right corner

#### How to Clone
1. Log in(or Sign Up) to Github
2. Go to repository for this project [Sportpulse](https://github.com/rasm1/SportPulse)
3. Click on the code button, select whether you would like to clone with HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI and copy the link shown.
4. Open the terminal in your code editor and change the current working directory to the location you want to use for the cloned directory.
5. Type the following command in the terminal (after the git clone you will need to paste the link you copied in step 3 above)
6. Set up a virtual environment (this step is not required if you are using the Code Institute Template in GitPod as this will already be set up for you).
7. Install the packages from the requirements.txt file - run Command pip3 install -r requirements.txt

### Heroku Deployment
* Log into [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) account or create an account.
* Click the "New" button at the top right corner and select "Create New App".
* Enter a unique application name
* Select your region
* Click "Create App"

#### Prepare enviroment and settings.py
* In your GitPod workspace, create an env.py file in the main directory.
* Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file.
* Update the settings.py file to import the env.py file and add the SECRETKEY and DATABASE_URL file paths.
* Comment out the default database configuration.
* Save all files and make migrations.
* Add the STATIC files settings - the url, storage path, directory path, root path, media url and default file storage path.
* Link the file to the templates directory in Heroku.
* Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR
* Add Heroku to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list the format ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']

#### Add the following Config Vars in Heroku:

* SECRET_KEY - This can be any Django random secret key
* PORT = 8000
* DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC = 1 - this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment
* DATABASE_URL - Insert your own ElephantSQL database URL here

#### Heroku needs two additional files to deploy properly

* requirements.txt
* Procfile

#### Deploy

1. Make sure DEBUG = False in the settings.py
2. Go to the deploy tab on Heroku and connect to GitHub, then to the required repository.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the deploy page and either click Enable Automatic Deploys for automatic deploys or Deploy Branch to deploy manually. Manually deployed branches will need re-deploying each time the GitHub repository is updated.
4. Click 'Open App' to view the deployed live site.

Site is now live

## Testing

### Responsiveness Testing

The deployed website underwent rigorous testing on multiple devices and screen sizes to ensure its responsiveness and adaptability. Developer Tools were utilized to simulate various screen sizes, enabling thorough examination of how the website behaves across different devices. Bootstrap classes and media queries were implemented to achieve the desired design, ensuring that the website maintains its visual and functional integrity on all platforms, enhancing the user experience.
