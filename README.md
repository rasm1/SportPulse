### Project Goals

The goal of Sportpulse is to create a forum where users can easily and seamlessly communicate with like minded individuals to learn more about everything fitness related.

### Agile Methodology

Agile Methodology was used to help prioritize and organize tasks, writting the user stories and using Project Boards on Github. Template was created to help write User Stories

* User stories were created by looking at possible user needs and through iterations.
* Project Board is set to public.
* Project Board was used to track progression of the task through the Todo, In progress and Done columns
* Labels were added to sort the issues based on the importance and difficulty.

### Data Models

1. AllAuth User Model
    * Django Allauth, the User model is the default user model provided by the Django authentication system
    
---
2. Comment Model
    * Model made so that users can leave a comment on all posts
    * Comments can only be edited/ deleted by the original author
    * The User entity has a one-to-many relationship with the Comments entity. This means that a User can have multiple comments. But multiple comments cannot be made multiple users.
---
3. Post model
    * Model made so users can make posts on the forum.
    * the user entity has a one-to-many relationship with the post model. This means that one user can make multiple posts but multiple posts cannot have multiple users.
